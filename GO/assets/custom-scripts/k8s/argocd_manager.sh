# ArgoCD application manager.
#
# A small dispatcher over the `argocd` CLI, with fzf where it helps. Mirrors
# the spirit of the `k` / `aw` / `tf` shell functions: short verbs that wrap
# the common case, passthrough for everything else.
#
# Usage:
#   argocd_manager.sh                     # show cheat sheet
#   argocd_manager.sh list                # list apps (table)
#   argocd_manager.sh app                 # fzf-pick an app, then act on it
#   argocd_manager.sh sync <app>          # sync an app
#   argocd_manager.sh diff <app>          # diff live vs desired
#   argocd_manager.sh status <app>        # show app status
#   argocd_manager.sh history <app>       # deployment history
#   argocd_manager.sh rollback <app> <id> # rollback to a history id
#   argocd_manager.sh logs <app>          # tail app logs (workload pods)
#   argocd_manager.sh refresh <app>       # hard-refresh app state
#
# Requires the `argocd` CLI and a logged-in context (`argocd login`).
